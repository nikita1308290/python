story = ''' Many of the inspiring moral stories in the short story collection are written from children’s perspectives. “A Boy Who Came Back From Heaven” by Philip Pullman is a wonderful example of how children can relate to a situation and feel what the characters are feeling.

This short book is full of excellent parables. Pullman also creates an interesting plot with the main character that takes up the entire length of this book. The collection’s other stories are excellent for teaching children about love, life, and morals.

“One Day We Came Together” by Margret Wise Brown is another touching story of how two girls live happily ever after. Dot, the central character, and her sister Irina live happily ever since they get married and start a family. However, things do not go as easily as expected, and there are many bumps in the road as their relationship gets tested. Every reader can relate to this happy ending in one way or the other.


“The Fox and the Hound” by Arthur C Clarke is a famous short story that has been made into a motion picture. The story tells the story of a fox who loves to live among squirrels. He can observe them and get into trouble. One day, the fox spots a young squirrel that was thrown across a bridge.

The fox goes over to the squirrel and tries to help him over the bridge. When the squirrel refuses to come down, the fox lets the squirrel fall to the ground and walks off. The lesson here is that it is always easier to build a relationship with someone than to force it.
